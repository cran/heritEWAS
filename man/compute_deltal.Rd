\usage{
compute_deltal(typed.genos, M_values, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{typed.genos}{A named list, usually generated by
\code{\link{calc_geno_probs}}.
Each element of the list is a data frame specifying all possible joint
genotypes of selected family members within each family, and the joint
probability of each genotype combination.}

\item{M_values}{A matrix of M-values,with rows corresponding to the
methylation sites and columns corresponding to people.
The column names should correspond to the column names appearing in
\code{typed.genos}.}

\item{ncores}{The number of cores to be used, with \code{ncores = 1} (the default)
corresponding to non-parallel computing.
When \code{ncores > 1}, the \code{parallel} package is used to
parallelize the calculation, by dividing the methylation sites between
the cores.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 15 columns. In the column names, the suffixes
\code{.mendel} and \code{.mix} refer the Mendelian and mixture models of
(Joo et al., 2018).
Briefly, the mixture model is the standard Gaussian mixture model with two
groups (group \code{0} and group \code{1}),
so group memberships are independent and the M-values of each group are
normally distributed. The Mendelian model is the same except that group
memberships are dependent within families, and are modelled as the carrier
status of a rare, autosomal genetic variant.
In the column names, the prefixes \code{mu} and \code{sd} refer to the maximum
likelihood estimates of the mean and standard deviation of each group's
normal distribution, and the suffix \code{ll} refers to each model's maximised
log-likelihood (i.e., the log-likelihood function evaluated at the maximum
likelihood estimates).  The suffix \code{.null} refers to the null model that is
nested inside both the Mendelian and mixture models, in which the means and
standard deviations for the two groups are equal
(i.e., \code{mu0 = mu1} and \code{sd0 = sd1}).
The column \code{delta.l} gives the difference between \code{ll.mendel} and \code{ll.mix},
and is the measure of heritability (Delta l) that was introduced in
(Joo et al., 2018).
}
\description{
For each methylation site, compute a measure of heritability called Delta l
(with larger values corresponding to more highly heritable methylation
sites), which is described briefly below and fully in (Joo et al., 2018).

\examples{
# Example data
str(ped)
str(M_values)

# Calculate genotype probabilities
typed.genos <- calc_geno_probs(ped)
str(typed.genos)

\donttest{
# Compute Delta l
deltal <- compute_deltal(typed.genos, M_values, ncores = 4)
str(deltal)
}
